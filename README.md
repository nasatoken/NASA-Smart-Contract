## About

<p>$NASA

Launched in June 6th 2021, NASA or Not Another Shit Altcoin is a token built and deployed on the Binance Smart Chain network. NASA utilizes the raw power of memes to facilitate its goal of becoming the dependable memecoin of the future. 

All transactions are taxed at 10%, 5% of which is added to the liquidity pool and 5% is distributed out to each at every holder thus making NASA an attractive investment option. In addition to this, 5% of the initial supply was burnt making the token more scarce as time goes by..</p>
